Assignment 2:
- Create a Command Line Interface, similar to Linux.
- From the CLI, the user can create a process, see the processes running, and kill them.

Processes:
- DisplayDriver that displays text to HTML page
- KeyboardDriver that accepts keyboard characters
Basic Directory Operations:
- cls: clear the CLI screen
- cp: copy a file
- echo: displays user input message to screen
- ls: list all files in current directory
- ps: list all processes currently running
- rm: remove files
- kill: kills a process by its pid
- cat: reads files and writes it to screen

The usage of processes is similar to Linux, e.g. cp <fileName1> <fileName2> and echo <message>
